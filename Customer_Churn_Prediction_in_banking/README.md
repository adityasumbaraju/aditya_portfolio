# Customer Churn Prediction in banking
<b>Business Problem </b> </br>
Customer churn exists across businesses in many sectors, especially since it significantly impacted banking. A company's growth depends on the high acquisition and low attrition rate. A high attrition rate represents a considerable investment loss, and both time and effort need to be channeled into replacing them. Predicting when a client is likely to leave and offering them incentives to stay can offer considerable savings to a business.
Predicting churn (attrition) is essential for any current subscription-based business. A slight fluctuation in churn can significantly impact the bottom line of any business. Hence it is vital to know- "Is this customer going to leave us within X months?" Yes or No?
